Use Case 2: Singleton Pattern

Problem Statement
     We need a `Logger` class where only one instance should exist throughout the application.  
     All components should use the same logger for consistent logging.

Design Pattern Applied
     Singleton Pattern – ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
